## 🔍 Analysis Performed

* Dataset loading and understanding
* Checking missing values
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Descriptive statistics
* Distribution analysis
* Basic visualizations using plots

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* Member data shows variation across different attributes
* Certain categories dominate the dataset
* Patterns can be observed using simple visual analysis

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis concepts
* Hands-on experience with customer/member datasets
* Improved data visualization skills
* Practical use of Python data analysis libraries

---

## 📌 Notes

* Virtual environment folders (`venv`, `myvenv`) are not included in the repository.
* Dependencies are managed using `requirments.txt`, which follows standard practice.
